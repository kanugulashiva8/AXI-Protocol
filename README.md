# AXI_Protocol

Tools: Notepad++, Icarus Verilog
• Designed and implemented a complete AXI4-Stream interface with master and slave modules, enabling high-speed data transfer
using a valid/ready handshake protocol.
• Developed using finite state machines (FSMs) to manage all five protocol channels for read and write operations.
• Architected and verified the system in Verilog HDL, ensuring robust, clock-synchronized data flow and seamless integration between components.
